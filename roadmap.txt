Absolutely — a clear roadmap helps turn a complex idea like a password manager extension into an achievable, modular build. Here's a step-by-step flow tailored for building your JavaScript-based browser extension with the following core goals:

✅ Password Generator
✅ Strength Checker
✅ Secure Vault (with Encryption)
✅ Autofill & Save Credentials
✅ Browser Extension UI (popup + content script)

🛣️ Password Manager Browser Extension Roadmap
🔰 PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP (Base Structure)
Step	Task
✅	Set up project directory in VS Code
✅	Create manifest.json (Manifest V3)
✅	Create folders: icons/, styles/, lib/
✅	Create basic files: popup.html, popup.js, background.js, content.js
✅	Load the extension into chrome://extensions in Developer Mode

🧪 PHASE 2: CORE UI & GENERATION LOGIC
Step	Task
🔲	Build popup.html with UI: password generator + strength bar
🔲	Use zxcvbn.js or similar to check password strength
🔲	Implement password generation in popup.js
🔲	Allow users to copy password to clipboard
🔲	Optional: Toggle password length, symbols, numbers, etc.

🔐 PHASE 3: SECURE VAULT & ENCRYPTION
Step	Task
🔲	Set up background.js to store encrypted credentials
🔲	Use WebCrypto API for AES-GCM encryption
🔲	Prompt for master password (first-time setup and every unlock)
🔲	Derive key from master password using PBKDF2 or scrypt
🔲	Store encrypted vault in chrome.storage.local
🔲	Add vault export/import (as encrypted JSON blob)

🧠 PHASE 4: CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT
Step	Task
🔲	Create UI to view stored sites and credentials (in popup or separate HTML page)
🔲	Implement Add/Edit/Delete logic in popup.js or vault.js
🔲	Save site name, username, password into the encrypted vault
🔲	Optional: Add a notes field or tags

🧬 PHASE 5: CONTENT SCRIPT (AUTOFILL)
Step	Task
🔲	In content.js, detect login forms
🔲	Send message to background.js to fetch credentials
🔲	Autofill username + password
🔲	Add "Save Password?" prompt if user manually logs in with new credentials
🔲	Auto-detect domain name (window.location.hostname) to match vault entries

🧾 PHASE 6: OPTIONS & SETTINGS PAGE
Step	Task
🔲	Add options.html and options.js
🔲	Let user:
  • Change master password	
  • Toggle dark mode	
  • Set password generation rules	
🔲	Store user preferences in chrome.storage.local

💬 PHASE 7: POLISH & UX
Step	Task
🔲	Add animations, tooltips, better icons
🔲	Add error handling (wrong master password, corrupted vault)
🔲	Add secure unlock timeout (auto-lock vault after X minutes)
🔲	Display helpful messages when no vault or no credentials found
🔲	Add favicon favicon detection (for domain entries)

🧪 PHASE 8: TESTING & HARDENING
Step	Task
🔲	Test on different websites with login forms
🔲	Use Chrome DevTools to inspect script behavior
🔲	Test vault encryption/decryption integrity
🔲	Add code comments and organize reusable functions

📦 FINAL: BUILD & SHIP
Step	Task
🔲	Validate manifest and extension structure
🔲	Zip the folder for Chrome Web Store
🔲	(Optional) Port to Firefox by tweaking manifest
🔲	Document your extension (README, instructions, repo)

🎯 Milestone Breakdown (Recommended)
Milestone	Deliverable
M1	Working extension UI + password generator + strength meter
M2	Secure vault storage with encrypted entries
M3	Autofill working on common login forms
M4	Complete credential management + settings
